        <p>There are a few elements to a great meatball sub sandwich. 
            First, you need good meatballs. 
            Since they are the star of the show, I like to make my own meatballs for these subs, starting with our Italian Meatballs. 
            I halve the recipe to make enough meatballs for 4 subs, but you can use the original recipe and have leftovers. 
            (I also just use ground beef for simplicity, but a mix of beef and pork is great if you have both on hand). 

            Second, the bread is important. It needs to be a sturdy roll to hold up to the heavy meatballs and the sauce; you don’t want it to get too soggy. 
            Third, toppings are key. I like melty provolone cheese, fresh basil, and banana peppers for a little kick. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>For the meatballs:</h3>

<li>1/3 cup whole milk, warmed</li>
<li>1 slice white bread, crumbled</li>
<li>1 pound ground beef (80 to 85% lean)</li>
<li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1/2 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1 cup Italian breadcrumbs, for coating</li>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil, for searing</li>
<li>24 ounces good quality marinara sauce</li>

<h3>For the subs</h3>

<li>4 large hoagie rolls, 6 to 8 inches long</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter or olive oil</li>
<li>8 slices provolone cheese</li>

<li>Banana peppers, for garnish (optional)</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul id="step1"><i>Step 1:</i> Prepare the meatball mixture: 
            Add the warm milk to a large bowl with the crumbled bread and let soak for a minute or two.  Then add the ground beef, Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley, salt, and oregano. Mix with your hands until combined; it’s okay if there are a few bread chunks still.</ul>
        <ul id="step2"><i>Step 2:</i> Shape the meatballs: 
            Using wet hands, shape the mixture into about 16 even meatballs—each should be around 1 ounce, or 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Coat each meatball in breadcrumbs and set it on a baking sheet while you shape the rest of the meatballs.</ul>
        <ul id="step3"><i>Step 3:</i> Sear the meatballs: 
            Add the olive oil to a large skillet over medium heat. Once it’s glistening hot, add the meatballs, searing for a few minutes on every side. Once seared, transfer the meatballs to a medium saucepan and add the marinara sauce.</ul>
        <ul id="step4"><i>Step 4:</i> Simmer the meatballs: 
            Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add up to 1 cup of water to the pot if the marinara sauce seems too thick. Once the sauce is simmering, turn the heat down to low and cover with the lid, leaving it ajar so some steam can escape. Simmer until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes. </ul>
        <ul id="step5"><i>Step 5:</i>Assemble and bake the meatball subs: 
            Preheat the oven to 450˚F. 
            
            Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Using a bread knife, slice the hoagie rolls down the center, leaving the two sides attached, and open them up like a book. Add a little butter or drizzle of oil to the skillet and add the rolls cut side down. Cook until the hoagies are toasted, about 2 minutes. You will likely need to toast them 1 or 2 at a time, depending on the size of your skillet.
            
            Scoop 4 meatballs out of the marinara sauce and chop them in half. Add them to a toasted hoagie and spoon about 1/2 cup of sauce over the top of the meatballs. Top with 2 slices of provolone. Repeat with the remaining rolls and meatballs.
            
            Bake the hoagies until the cheese is well melted, about 5 minutes. Top with basil and banana peppers, if desired. Serve immediately. 
        </ul>
